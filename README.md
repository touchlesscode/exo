<h1 align="center">EXO</h1>
<p align="center">A blueprint for a more open, accessible, future-proof world.</p>

## :hear_no_evil: What's this about?

EXO is the scaffolding required to make a more accessible world. It's comprised of a few key pieces:

1. A universal data schema
2. A lightweight smart loader to enable those with autism to use the web without frustration
3. A bottomless ReactJS web shell which connects to headless systems and APIs

## :zap: Roadmap

EXO is a collaboration of folks who care about making the world usable for people with autism. It turns out when we do that, the business metrics improve too. We're excited to have Gatsby, Rudderstack, Sanity and others involved in us building a true enterprise-grade, scalable and open-source framework we continually will improve. 

### Now:

Beta release set for March 2. 

- <a href="https://github.com/touchlesscode/schema">Touchless Schema</a> for: Person, Accomodation
- EXO for GatsbyJS, found in <a href="https://github.com/touchlesscode/packages/gatsby-theme-exo">/packages/gatsby-theme-exo</a>
   - more to merge in from recent projects for large companies that will likely be useful to most. 
- Making our documentation public in here for Touchless Identity and EXO APIs. 

### Next:

- EXO for NextJS
- EXO for Svelte
- Schema for Organization, Relationship, Address
