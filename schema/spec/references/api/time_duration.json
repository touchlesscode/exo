The ISO 8601 standard duration representation format is described as PyYmMdDThHmMsS. For more information, see [Durations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). Make provisions to incorporate the effects of daylight savings time. When an amount is zero, you can omit it. Because week cannot co-exist with other time components in ISO 8601 Duration, use P7D.",
