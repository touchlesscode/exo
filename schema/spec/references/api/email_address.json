To validate an email address, services must send an email to it and not rely on static validation of the address.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Due to RFC 5321, an email address can be up to 254 characters long even though up to 64 characters are allowed before and 255 characters are allowed after the @ sign. It is nearly impossible to define a regular expression that validates email addresses correctly, especially after you take internationalization into account. This pattern verifies only that the string contains an unquoted @ sign.</blockquote>",
