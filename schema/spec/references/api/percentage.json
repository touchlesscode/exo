Valid number formats are plain decimal numbers and whole numbers. Unlike a JSON number or JSON schema number type, this value MUST NOT be deserialized in JavaScript into a JavaScript Number object, which is 64-bit floating-point and cannot accurately represent all values transmitted by this type. Likewise, in Java, this type MUST be deserialized into a BigDecimal or other fixed-point numeric type.",
